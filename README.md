## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles, as first I started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Book Manager target users are:

* Aged 01-99
* Book lovers, anyone who loves to read and want to share it
* Would like to meet new people
* Would like to get inspired by others recommendations

What these users would be looking for:

* Clear information on how to follow through the website and easy-to-use navigation
* Good & simple-looking design which makes the website look desirable
* Possibility to register and share their ideas
* Possibility to search through books by author, book or category name
* Access to social media links to follow the news

This project has been built to offer all of these things. An effort was taken to provide as intuitive interaction as possible for every user visiting the webpage.

Due to the wide age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site not only on their mobile phones but also on their tablets or computers. Therefore, creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**

To achieve the desired user and business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

* Simple Home section with navigation panel and information below, including footer as well
